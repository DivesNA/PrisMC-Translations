# > Variables are placed in certain messages to be swapped out for a player's username or other information.
#   These variables appear in brackets(ex: [PLAYER] [FRIEND] [MORTAL_ENEMY]), and will be auto-
#   filled by the server. DO NOT change the text within the brackets, otherwise the server will not-
#   know to replace the text.
